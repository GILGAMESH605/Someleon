You: Hi Mark — circling back on the pilot. Any updates from your side?
Him: We’re evaluating 2 vendors. Your pricing still feels high.
You: Totally hear you. We can be flexible if the scope is clear.
Him: Also your onboarding timeline seems risky. We need this live in 3 weeks.
You: We can do it, but we’d need faster access to your data + a technical POC call.
Him: Not sure we can commit to that this week.
