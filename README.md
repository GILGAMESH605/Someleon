The Context-Aware Social Strategist.

Concept: An AI Agent that doesn't just "reply," but constructs psychological profiles of the interlocutor and browses the live web (via Firecrawl) to find niche communication strategies (e.g., specific sales closers, dating trends, or cultural references) before formulating a response.
